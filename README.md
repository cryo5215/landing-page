This project is a demonstration of core HTML and CSS skills, built as part of The Odin Project's Foundations curriculum. The goal was to replicate a provided webpage design from scratch, focusing on structure, layout, and styling.

Features
The landing page is a complete, single-page design that includes several distinct sections:

Header: A clean navigation bar with a logo and links.

Hero Section: A prominent "call to action" with a title, descriptive text, a sign-up button, and an image placeholder.

Information Section: A panel displaying four items, each with an illustration and subtext.

Quote Section: An inspiring quote block designed to break the page flow and provide social proof.

Call to Action (CTA) Box: A final, visually distinct sign-up section to capture user attention.

Footer: A simple footer with copyright information.

Technologies Used
This project was built using foundational web technologies:

HTML5: For structuring the content and semantics.

CSS3: For all styling, layout, and design.

Flexbox: Heavily used for arranging elements and creating a responsive layout.

Git & GitHub: For version control and project hosting.

What I Learned
This project was a comprehensive exercise in translating a static design into a functional webpage. Key takeaways include:

Reinforcing the importance of a well-structured HTML document.

Gaining significant practice with CSS Flexbox to align and distribute items.

Managing a project from scratch and committing changes with Git.

Developing an eye for detail by matching specific font sizes, colors, and spacing from a design file.
